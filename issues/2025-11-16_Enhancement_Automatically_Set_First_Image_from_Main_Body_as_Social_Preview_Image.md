## Raw

I don't think images are being pulled out of the main body text and used as the image of tribute if I haven't provided one. I also wonder whether we should distinguish the image in the front matter from the social preview image attribute; that's made a different question actually.

The main point is that I want as a user, if I put an image in the main body of my text, there's automatic use for social preview image. I think probably the first image in the text, and maybe there's some way I can override that or disable that if I want. For example, if I set an image in the front matter, that's probably used instead.
